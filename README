These are practice exercises for an introductory Vim lecture.

Please see the `LICENSE' file.

To do this with the class, have them copy everything back to their home
directories.  This is best accomplished by having them run the `setup' script
EXACTLY like this:

	python setup

or from their home directories, it would be something like this:

	python /path/to/some/universally/accessible/place/vimPractice/setup
